# MERN Stack Shopping List

## [Heroku || LIVE]()
## [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/grantspell/mern-shoppingList)

## Overview + Experience :
### This application allows the user to Create, Read and Delete items from a shopping list. The outside appearance is clean and minimal, while there is a lot going on behind the UI.
### This is my first hands on experience with Redux via following [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)'s video tutorials. This being a codealong project allowed me to see, step by step, the complexity of working with Redux and how much it offers. Also, I had become accustom to using `styled-components` with React for most of my UI work, but using `Bootstrap` and `Reactstrap` together for the first time left a lasting impact! The design is clean, responsive and took a lot less time than using modular css styling. My greatest challenge was the Redux boilerplate code, but after the initial setup/overview of its process, I was able to pause the video and work ahead, using the videos to check my code/refactor. I am feeling less intimidated by Redux and am excited to explore its robust functionality in future projects!
